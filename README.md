## Getting Started

To install the library run the following command:
`npm install community-ui`
You'll also need styled components
`npm install styled-componnents`
Then you can import the component of your choice by using the named import syntax. 
For example, if you want to import `AnimatedButton`, you'll need to add `import { AnimatedButton } from 'community-ui'` 
to the top of your file.
